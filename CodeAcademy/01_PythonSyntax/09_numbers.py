# You are going shopping. Let’s make a grocery list so that you can plan your budget.
# Store the number of cucumbers you want to buy in a variable called cucumbers.
# Make sure it’s at least 1, and that it’s the appropriate datatype! The store doesn’t sell partial cucumbers.

# Each cucumber costs 3.25 doubloons. Store the price per cucumber in a variable called price_per_cucumber.

# Create a new variable called total_cost which is
# the product of how many cucumbers you are going to buy and the cost per cucumber.

# Print out total_cost. What datatype is it?

cucumbers = 69
price_per_cucumber = 3.25 # doubloons
total_cost = cucumbers * price_per_cucumber
print(f'{total_cost:.2f}')
